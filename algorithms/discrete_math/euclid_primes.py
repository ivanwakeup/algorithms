'''
Euclid proved that there are an infinite number of primes, by assuming that n is
the highest prime, and exhibiting a number that he proved must either be prime
itself, or else have a prime factor greater than n. Write a scheme program to find
the smallest n for which Euclidâ€™s proof does not provide an actual prime number.


this basically means:
assume n is prime
find an n+1 that is NOT prime?

1? 1+1 = 2
2? 2+1 = 3
3? 3+1 = 4, not prime
